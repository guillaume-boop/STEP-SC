/**
 * StdChains provides information about EVM compatible chains that can be used in scripts/tests.
 * For each chain, the chain's name, chain ID, and a default RPC URL are provided. Chains are
 * identified by their alias, which is the same as the alias in the `[rpc_endpoints]` section of
 * the `foundry.toml` file. For best UX, ensure the alias in the `foundry.toml` file match the
 * alias used in this contract, which can be found as the first argument to the
 * `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl` call in the `initializeStdChains` function.
 *
 * There are two main ways to use this contract:
 *   1. Set a chain with `setChain(string memory chainAlias, ChainData memory chain)` or
 *      `setChain(string memory chainAlias, Chain memory chain)`
 *   2. Get a chain with `getChain(string memory chainAlias)` or `getChain(uint256 chainId)`.
 *
 * The first time either of those are used, chains are initialized with the default set of RPC URLs.
 * This is done in `initializeStdChains`, which uses `setChainWithDefaultRpcUrl`. Defaults are recorded in
 * `defaultRpcUrls`.
 *
 * The `setChain` function is straightforward, and it simply saves off the given chain data.
 *
 * The `getChain` methods use `getChainWithUpdatedRpcUrl` to return a chain. For example, let's say
 * we want to retrieve the RPC URL for `mainnet`:
 *   - If you have specified data with `setChain`, it will return that.
 *   - If you have configured a mainnet RPC URL in `foundry.toml`, it will return the URL, provided it
 *     is valid (e.g. a URL is specified, or an environment variable is given and exists).
 *   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the default data is returned.
 *
 * Summarizing the above, the prioritization hierarchy is `setChain` -> `foundry.toml` -> environment variable -> defaults.
